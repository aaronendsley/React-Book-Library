# Book Library

This App is a simple application I've built for trying out some things I've learned about: React, Tailwind, Vite, and Vitest.

I chose to use [fakerApi](https://fakerapi.it/en) to get a list of randomly generated "not real" books.

My main goal was to see if I could implement all the things I learned in the Front End Masters Intro to React Course and Intermediate React courses in the [React Learning Path](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/react/).
